[mod-setting-description]
ghost-scanner-scan-areas-per-tick=how many logistic network cells are scanned on each tick\nLower numbers greatly improve performance.\nDefault=5
ghost-scanner-update-interval=Minimum time between ticks when Ghost Scanners are looked at for logistic network updates.\nIf number of scanners is larger than this value, then time is doubled\nDefault = 180
ghost-scanner-max-results=Limits ghosts found per Ghost Scanner. Modules are not counted individually.\nLower numbers greatly improve performance.\nSet to 0 to remove limit.\nDefault = 1000
ghost-scanner-show-hidden=Enable to show hidden items e.g. LTN input/output.
ghost-scanner-negative-output=Output as negative numbers for use as LTN requests.
ghost-scanner-round2stack=Rounds item counts up (down with Invert output) to next full item stack.
ghost-scanner-area-scan-delay=Minimum time between ticks that scans for ghost-like entities are performed.
