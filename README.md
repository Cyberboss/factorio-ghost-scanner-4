## Development

You'll need a node 22+ environment setup. VSCode is the recommended IDE.

Run `yarn` to install dependencies like the typescript-to-lua compiler and typed-factorio definitions.

Run `yarn build` to build the mod `.zip` in the `build/` directory.

Run `yarn install_mod` to build and copy the mod to `~/AppData/Roaming/Factorio/mods`.
